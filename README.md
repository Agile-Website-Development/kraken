# Kraken
Kraken is a lightweight, mobile-first boilerplate for front-end web developers. It includes just the essentials:

* A CSS reset to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
* A responsive, mobile-first grid.
* A well-designed, fluid typographic scale.
* CSS3 buttons.
* Basic form styling.
* Optional add-ons for more functionality.

## How It Works
Getting started with Kraken is really easy. [View the online tutorial](http://cferdinandi.github.com/kraken/), or dig through the `example.html` file.

## Get Involved
Kraken is an open-source project. If you build an add-on, fix a bug, or figure out a better way to do something, let me know!
