# Kraken
Kraken is a lightweight, mobile-first boilerplate for front-end web developers.

It includes just the essentials:

* A CSS reset to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
* A responsive, mobile-first grid.
* A well-designed, fluid typographic scale.
* CSS3 buttons.
* Basic form styling

### Designed to Expand
Kraken was built to be lightweight but expandable. It includes links to a variety of tools that were designed to work together - icon-fonts, navigation menus, dropdowns, toggle tabs and more.

## How It Works
Getting started with Kraken is really easy. [View the online tutorial](http://cferdinandi.github.com/kraken/), or dig through the `example.html` file.
